#  Student Record System

A simple C++ console application to manage student data. This project demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) logic using File Handling.

##  Features
* ENTER Record: Save student info to a file.
* DISPLAY : Display every student in the database which you have entered.
* Search: Find a specific student by their ID.
* Update:  Updata existing records.
* Delete:  remove existing records.

##  How it Works
The program uses the `fstream` library to create a `.dat` or `.txt` file on your computer. This ensures that your data is not lost even after you close the program (**Data Persistence**).

##  How to Run
1. Download `management system of student record.cpp`.
2. Open your terminal or IDE (like Dev-C++ or VS Code).
3. Compile and Run.
